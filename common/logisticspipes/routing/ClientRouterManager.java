/**
 * The routers this client has seen, so the HUD can find the pipes around the player.
 *
 * <p>Separate from {@link RouterManager} because the two never shared anything: the client list
 * holds {@link ClientRouter}s, is filled by the pipes themselves and emptied when a level loads,
 * while the server list is a different type under a different lock with its own uuid index. Keeping
 * both in one object meant that object had to work out which of its two callers it was serving, and
 * with a single manager shared by both sides of a singleplayer game the only thing left to ask was
 * the name of the calling thread.
